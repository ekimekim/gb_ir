Very simple and dirty program for analysing infrared signals.

Expects a signal that is a short burst with few state changes.
Records the pattern of state changes.

Shown on screen is up to 64 values. Each one is a 16-bit hex value showing
the number of "ticks" elapsed since the last state change. The initial state is
no signal. Values >= ff00 indicate an out of range value, ie. "longer than ff00
by an unknown amount". So a sequence like ff00 0100 0080 0180
would indicate that after a long time with no signal, we got a pulse for 256 ticks,
then a gap for 128 ticks, then a pulse for another 384 ticks.

Right now one tick is set at ~64us (2^14 Hz).

Note that after 64 values are shown, the oldest ones will be overwritten in order.

The program may not behave correctly if many state transitions happen extremely rapidly
(more than 127 in a short time, or more than 240/sec sustained).
